# STIX Document Validator (sdv) BETA
A python tool used to validate STIX v1.0 instance documents. For more information about the
Structured Thread Information eXpression, see http://stix.mitre.org.

## Dependencies
The STIX Document Validator has the following dependencies:
* Python v2.7 http://python.org/download
* lxml >= v3.2.0 http://lxml.de/index.html#download
  * libxml2 >= v2.9.1 http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

**NOTE:** Older versions of libxml2 do not work properly and may result in undesirable behavior.
To see what version of libxml2 you have installed, execute the `xml2-config --version` command
and make sure you are running at least v2.9.1.

For a Windows installer of lxml, we recommend looking here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

## Use
The STIX Document Validator can validate a STIX v1.0.1 instance document against STIX v1.0.1 schemas
found locally or referenced remotely through the schemaLocation attribute. It can also perform
some 'best practice' guidance checks.

Validate against local schemas:
`python sdv.py --input-file <stix_document.xml> --schema-dir schema`

Validate using schemaLocation:
`python sdv.py --input-file <stix_document.xml> --use-schemaloc`

Validate a directory of STIX documents:
`python sdv.py --input-dir <stix_dir> --schema-dir schema`

Check 'best practice' guidance
`python sdv.py --input-file <stix_document.xml> --schema-dir schema --best-practices`

## All STIX Documents?
The STIX Document Validator bundles a schema directory with it, which includes all STIX v1.0.1 
schema files. If an instance document uses constructs or languages defined by other schemas
a user must point the STIX Document Validator at those schemas in order to validate.
